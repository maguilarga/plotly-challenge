# Belly Button Biodiversity

![Bacteria Image](Images/bacteria1.jpg)

In this assignment we explore a data set on the different bacteria that could call home the human belly button.
A full stack application was developed to provide an easier way of traversing the data and learn about this thirlling topic. This stack was deployed, using heroku, to URL: https://magu-belly-diverse.herokuapp.com/

Data is stored in a sqlLite database, accessed via Python and SQLAlchemy, passed to javascripts using Python and Flask and charted using javascirpts and Plotly. The structure of the website is provided with HTML, while the formatting is achieved with boostrap and a local CSS.

### Prerequisites

Please check file "requirements.txt" for a full llist of libraries and versions


## Running the tests

Run directly the web site by opening the URL "https://magu-belly-diverse.herokuapp.com/" in a web browser

Run locally by:
1. Create a local directory
2. Copy the repo into your local directory
3. Execute python program "app.py"


## Built With
* [python] (https://docs.python.org/3/) - version 3.6.2
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) - version 0.24.2
